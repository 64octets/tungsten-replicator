# Oracle Redo Reader Replication Prerequisite Check Script

The pre-req-checker.sql script will install a PL/SQL Package in the DB instance, which you can then run to check for any unsupported features, data types etc.  

## INSTALLATION

The SQL package should be installed and executed as follows:

1. Copy the pre-req-checker sql script to the Oracle host machine.
2. Login to sqlplus as sys
3. Install the package as follow:

	$ sqlplus '/ as sydba' @pre-req-checker.sql

Step 3 above, is one time only, now that the package has been installed, you can run it as many times as you require.  

## USAGE 

To Execute the package and run the checks, from the sqlplus prompt, type the following:

	SQL> set serveroutput on
	SQL> exec ContinuentPreReqCheck.run(<target>,<schema>,<user>,<path>);

Substituting variables as follows:

*  *target*	The flavour of DB that you are replicating TO, one of 'ORACLE','MYSQL55','MYSQL56'
*  *schema*	A comma separated list of schemas that you will be replicating
*  *user*		The replicator user on the local source instance (Typically tungsten)
*  *path*		The local OS path for the results of the checker to be logged to

After executing, you will see a message that output has been written to a log file, the name and path will be given, and will look something similar to the following:

	SQL> set serveroutput on
	SQL> exec ContinuentPreReqCheck.run('ORACLE','LAB','TUNGSTEN','/home/oracle/log');
	>> Checks complete, results in /home/oracle/log/prereq-201511020730.log
	PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

You can then review the log file for the results, from the above example the log looks like the following:

	$> cat /home/oracle/log/prereq-201511020730.log

	INFO  >> Major Version : 11 Minor Version : 2
	PASS  >> Source Version Check [1]
	ERROR >> Table [LAB.DEMOTABLE] : Column [COL_ERR] is of unsupported datatype [ROWID]
	FAIL  >> Data Type Check [0]
	ERROR >> Table [LAB.DEMOTABLE] does not have a Primary Key
	ERROR >> Table [LAB.LABTAB1] does not have a Primary Key
	FAIL  >> Primary Key Check [0]
	PASS  >> Unsupported Features Check [1]
	INFO  >> User [TUNGSTEN] exists
	INFO  >> [TUNGSTEN] user has DBA role
	PASS  >> User Check [1]

## CAVEAT

The file created with the result is named using a timestamp with granularity of one minute. If you run the check the pre-requisite, fix the error and run the script again within 1 minute, you will see the error again, because the checking script is *adding* to the log, not creating a new one. If you fix a pre-requisite issue, allow one minute delay before checking again.
