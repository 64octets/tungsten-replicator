The scripts in this directory demonstrate how to use Oracle data
pump to dump and restore data.  Usage instructions are as follows.

1.) Copy sample-dp-shell.env to dp-shell.env.  Edit the parameters
as desired.

2.) To dump data run the expdp-shell.sh script.  This will generated
a backup that you can optionally rsync to another host.

3.) To load data run the impdp-shell.sh script giving the backup
name.  (To be implemented.)
